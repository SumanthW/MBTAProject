## OVERVIEW 
- The Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority, more commonly known as the T, is one of
the oldest public transit systems in the United States. Thousands of people buy tickets and use
‘Charlie cards’ to access and travel by the trains everyday.
The MBTA database management system project involves the development and implementation
of a centralized database to store and manage information related to the operations of the MBTA.
This can include data on routes, ticketing, finances and operations. The goal of the project is to
provide a single source of truth for all relevant data and to improve the efficiency and accuracy
of MBTA operations.
- This System facilitates functionalities like buying and top up- of tickets, pass as well as charlie
cards, checking the status of the cards and their expiry dates, showing the stations for the transits,
also the transactions in the stations with their timestamps and value. In Addition, the system also
shows the operations whether the line and station is active or inactive due to construction or any
other difficulties so that it's easy for the people to travel as well as it helps solve business
problems and gather reports.
